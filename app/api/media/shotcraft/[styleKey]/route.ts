/**
 * Same-origin proxy for the upstream ShotCraft preview clips.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The Motion Studio preview clips are published by the upstream `video-shotcraft`
 * repository as GitHub release assets. Two browser policies make a direct
 * cross-origin reference unusable in the Step 4 preview:
 *
 *   1. CORS — GitHub release assets do not send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`,
 *      so any `fetch()`-based media loader is rejected. The Remotion player
 *      (mediabunny `UrlSource`) slices the clip with `fetch()` + `Range`
 *      requests, so it fails outright.
 *   2. CSP — `connect-src` would have to allow the upstream host for that
 *      fetch, which would widen the app's outbound allow-list for every page.
 *
 * Proxying through this route fixes both: the browser only ever talks to its
 * own origin, so there is no CORS pre-flight and no new CSP origin is needed
 * for `connect-src`. The bytes served are the *existing* upstream MP4s — this
 * route never generates, re-encodes or substitutes a video.
 *
 * `Range` support is forwarded verbatim so the player can seek.
 *
 * WHICH UPSTREAM
 * --------------
 * The clips are published twice: as GitHub release assets under the
 * `gallery-media` tag, and as the published site media at
 * `vincentwei1021.github.io/video-shotcraft/media`. The two are NOT always the
 * same bytes: upstream re-uploads a clip when it is revised, and the release
 * asset is frozen at the time of the release. A byte-level comparison of the
 * current catalogue (150 style keys) found the release mirror serving the
 * OLDER cut for re-uploaded clips (e.g. `basic-3d-scene`, `multiplane`,
 * `split-text-stagger`) while the site origin serves the current one, and the
 * release mirror also sends `application/octet-stream` where the site origin
 * sends `video/mp4`.
 *
 * The site origin is therefore the primary source of truth here, and the
 * release asset is kept as a fallback so a single upstream outage cannot take
 * the whole Motion Studio library offline. Both origins carry all 150 clips.
