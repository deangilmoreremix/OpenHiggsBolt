/**
 * Request headers for fetching business WEBSITES.
 *
 * The agent identifies the crawler honestly in the standard
 * `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Name/version; +url)` form that search-engine
 * crawlers use. An earlier version imitated desktop Chrome; a before/after
 * check against real sites showed it changed nothing on ordinary sites and
 * got the crawl BLOCKED (403) by a bot-managed site that served the honest
 * agent, because a "Chrome" that does not behave like Chrome is exactly what
 * bot management looks for. A site that refuses the crawler is respected:
 * nothing here tries to get past a refusal.
 *
 * What is kept from the browser-like set are the content-negotiation headers
 * (Accept, Accept-Language), which some hosts need to serve the normal HTML.
 *
 * OpenStreetMap services (Nominatim / Overpass) keep their own
 * `SmartVideoGO-AI/1.0` agent, per their usage policies.
