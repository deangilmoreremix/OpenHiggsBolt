/**
 * Server-side helper: download an image from a public URL and return it as a
 * base64 data URL so the client can upload it through the existing
 * `uploadAsset()` / `uploadFile()` lifecycle.
 *
 * SSRF: every URL — the initial one and every redirect hop — is validated
 * against the centralized `src/lib/networkSafety.ts` gate (protocol
 * allowlist, hostname literal checks for every private / metadata / ULA /
 * link-local / unspecified form, and DNS resolution that validates EVERY
 * address the host currently resolves to, so DNS rebinding is rejected).
 * The validated address is pinned to the outbound connection via
 * `safeRequestConfig`, so a DNS answer that flips between validation and
 * connect cannot move the socket to a private peer. axios' own redirect
 * following is disabled (`maxRedirects: 0` via the pin) and redirects are
 * followed manually so every hop pays the same validation price.
 *
 * Blocked destinations throw a `BlockedTargetError` (message carries the
 * "not allowed" substring the route maps to HTTP 400). A hostname that does
 * not resolve is "unreachable", not "blocked", and surfaces as a plain
 * `Error` so the caller's per-image mapping reports it as `ok: false`.
