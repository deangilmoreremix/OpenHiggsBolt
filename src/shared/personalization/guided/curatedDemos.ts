/**
 * Curated HiggsBolt demo videos offered in Simple Mode step 2.
 *
 * The list used to be built from a hardcoded 12-slug allowlist
 * (`CURATED_SLUGS`), which is why the grid only ever showed 12 demos even
 * though 123 playable demo videos ship in `public/media/**`.
 *
 * It is now derived from the full demo library registry
 * (`src/data/demoLibraryRegistry.ts`), which indexes every locally-hosted
 * demo video that passed the on-disk verification (file exists, non-empty,
 * real WebM/MP4 magic number) and is described by a source catalog.
 *
 * Registry entries only ever point at files under `public/media/**`:
 *   public/media/minimax-h3/videos/<slug>.webm  + previews/<slug>.svg
 *   public/media/promptfeed/videos/<file>.mp4    + previews/<file>.jpg
 *   public/media/seedance-1/videos/<slug>.mp4    + previews/<slug>.svg
 *   public/media/seedance-25/videos/<file>.webm  + previews/<slug>.jpg
 *
 * The registry keeps `sourceRepo` + `slug` from the original catalogs, so
 * `getCreateUrl()` still produces the same working template ids.
