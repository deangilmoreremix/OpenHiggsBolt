/**
 * Deterministic typography for the Remotion design layer.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
 * ----------------------
 * Every one of the five frozen upstream templates hardcodes a *system* font
 * stack as a module-level constant:
 *
 *     const FONT = '-apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif';
 *
 * That makes the rendered result machine-dependent. The same exported video
 * picks SF Pro on macOS, Segoe UI on Windows and whatever `sans-serif`
 * resolves to on a Linux box without Roboto — and the on-screen preview
 * (Remotion Player, real DOM) and the exported file (in-browser web
 * renderer, canvas) can disagree as well. The upstream files are frozen, so
 * the fix cannot live inside them; it lives here, in a module every adapter
 * can reach.
 *
 * THE FONT
 * --------
 * `public/fonts/personalization-sans-latin.woff2`
 *   Inter 4.001, variable (`wght` 100..900), Latin subset (230 codepoints),
 *   48 432 bytes, sha256
 *   c940764593d0fe5d596be327ca7558855e018039fb78509aa21921fd3644c3e4.
 *
 * Licence: SIL Open Font License 1.1.
 * Copyright 2016 The Inter Project Authors. The full licence text ships next
 * to the binary as `public/fonts/OFL.txt`; the attribution obligation is
 * spelled out in `docs/phase2/handoffs/A10.md`.
 *
 * The family is deliberately NOT called "Inter". The app's own
 * `next/font/google` Inter (`app/layout.js`) already registers a family
 * called "Inter", and a stylesheet that lands later in the cascade would win
 * over ours. "Personalization Sans" cannot collide with anything, so the
 * bundled file is always the face that is actually used.
 *
 * NO NETWORK
 * ----------
 * The only font source in this module is a same-origin path under
 * `public/fonts/`. Nothing here points at a remote host, so a branded render
 * never fetches a typeface from the network and never changes its glyphs
 * halfway through an export.
