/**
 * The concrete catalog of the Remotion designs.
 *
 * Phase 1 shipped five upstream templates (MIT, © 2026 Trimora Inc. /
 * RenderComp) as customer-facing "designs". Phase 2 (batch 1) adds ten more
 * from the same upstream repository, and Phase 2 (batch 2) adds four more from
 * a SECOND upstream repository (MIT, React Video Editor / remotion-templates).
 * Every entry pairs an upstream template with an adapter component that maps
 * the customer's brand data onto the upstream's props — the repo-1 upstream
 * files in `./_upstream` are frozen and are never edited (the repo-2 copies
 * are edited under contract addition C8, and every edit is recorded in the
 * copy's own header).
 *
 * The contract the adapters implement is documented in
 * `./_upstream/ADAPTER-SPEC.md`; the short version is:
 *
 *  - the upstream lays itself out against the COMPOSITION, so every adapter
 *    renders it inside a composition-sized canvas that is scaled into the
 *    design box (see `./designs/shared.tsx`);
 *  - the customer's video stays visible: every canvas fill is forced to
 *    `transparent`, except the end card, which is deliberately rendered as a
 *    bounded, solid CTA card;
 *  - the MIT attribution travels with every design (`source.attribution`),
 *    is available to the product UI through
 *    `getRemotionDesignAttributionLine()` / `REMOTION_DESIGN_LICENSE_NOTICE`,
 *    and is drawn as a small credit line inside the design itself.
 *
 * Upstream provenance (see `./_upstream/README.md`):
 *  - upstream repository: https://github.com/deangilmoreremix/free-remotion-templates
 *  - canonical repository (the repo's own `package.json → repository`):
 *    https://github.com/RenderComp/free-remotion-templates
 *  - the two URLs differ: the first is the clone the templates were copied
 *    from, the second is the canonical project the attribution points at.
