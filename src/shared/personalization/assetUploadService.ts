/**
 * Domain-level asset upload service for the Personalization system.
 *
 * This abstraction ensures the Personalization state does not depend on
 * which infrastructure stores or uploads media. Uploads go through the shared
 * MuAPI adapter (`@/lib/muapiUpload`), which routes every call through the
 * same-origin `/api/v1/upload_file` route — the same single endpoint the rest
 * of the app uses — and can be replaced or extended without touching
 * domain/state code.
 *
 * ── Why `url` is a durable URL and not the MuAPI URL ───────────────────────
 *
 * DEFECT (this file, before the shared adapter landed): the docstring below
 * promised "a durable URL", but the implementation returned the URL that
 * MuAPI's `upload_file` endpoint handed back. MuAPI upload URLs are
 * TEMPORARY: they expire one hour after they are issued. `DemoPersonalizeProvider`
 * (`src/shared/personalization/DemoPersonalizeProvider.tsx:1470`) stores the
 * returned value straight into the asset record as its `url` / `uploadedUrl`,
 * and `supabaseProjectPersistence` / `clientAssets` write that record to
 * long-term storage. An hour later the project still "had" its logo — the
 * identifier just pointed at nothing.
 *
 * FIX: the ORIGINAL bytes are written to durable storage first, and the
 * permanent identifier returned from this function is that durable reference.
 * The MuAPI URL is returned separately as `muapiUrl` and is treated as
 * strictly ephemeral. When an hour has passed, callers obtain a fresh MuAPI URL
 * with `resolvePersonalizationAssetMuAPIUrl`, which re-uploads the durable
 * original from authorized storage.
